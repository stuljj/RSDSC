# RSDSC
This is a Pytorch implementaion of Reliable Self-supercised Deep Subspace Clustering(RSDSC), as described in our paper:
...

## Introduction

In this repo, we provide RSDSC's code with the ORL datasets as example. The self-supervised deep subspace clustering method used in this code is provided by Zhang J , Li C G , You C , et al. [Self-Supervised Convolutional Subspace Clustering Network[C]// 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition] (CVPR 2019).( https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_Self-Supervised_Convolutional_Subspace_Clustering_Network_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf )

## Requirements
The codebase is implemented in Python 3.6.13. And package versions used for development are just below
* pytorch-gpu (1.0.0)
* scipy (1.5.4)
* numpy (1.19.5)
